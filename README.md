# Introduction
This fork is based on the code to the paper "White-box Fairness Testing through Adversarial Sampling" by Peixin Zhang, Jingyi Wang, Jun Sun, Guoliang Dong, Xinyu Wang, Xingen Wang, Ting Dai, Jinsong Dong in ICSE 2020.

New features are as follows:
- Speed up with Tensorflow 2
- Use Keras model
- Support fixing randomeness

# Environment
This fork is based on python 3.10 and tensorflow 2.11. The code was tested with miniconda on M1 Macbook Air.

In addition to tensorflow, required python packages are as follows:
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- z3-solver
- tensorflow-determinism
